# Reflection

- I do like the component system and I think it would be fun to use, however it is so significantly different than the technology I have been using for web apps that it is harder to get used to.

- As for the implementation, the components are well implemented but I feel like there is a much more simple way to go about this and as a result my project felt overly complicated for the end product. It is definitely expandable, but for a project this small it feels rather unnessecary.
